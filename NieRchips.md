#### About:
Made to be a second-screen companion for when you're selling/destroying chips you don't need,  
and for when you want to fuse combinations of chips.  

There are already plently of fan-made resource materials and spreadsheets on this,  
but this is the way of displaying the chip information that I find most useful.
